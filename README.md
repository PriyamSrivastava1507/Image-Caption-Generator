# Image-Caption-Generator
A Deep Learning model that automatically generates descriptive captions for images using CNN (InceptionV3) and LSTM. Trained on the Flickr8k dataset, this project combines Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand image context and generate human-like text.
